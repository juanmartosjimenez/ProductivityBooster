# ProductivityBooster

A chrome extension designed to boost your productivity. All you have to do is add a todo list and a list of websites that hinder your productivity and the extension will do its best to keep you on track with your goals for the day.

This project was designed and developed with my friend Liam Knowles. The goal of this project was to get familiarized with creating chrome plugins and to create a functional tool that helps us stay on track with out academic goals.
